# 🏃‍♂️ Run, Forrest! Run!

####  Every time `#runforrestrun` is used on Twitter, Forrest Gump runs another mile across America.

### The story
In 1979, Forrest Gump started running.

When he got tired, he slept. 

When he got hungry, he ate. 

When he had to go, you know, he went. 

3 years, 2 months, 14 days, and 16 hours later, he stopped... and went home. 

He'd run 13,089 miles. 

13,089!

### Ok, so why?
I built this for shits and giggles after finishing Le Wagon Amsterdam (batch 259), because I want to see how long it will take Forrest (with the help of the good people of the internet) to do it again.
